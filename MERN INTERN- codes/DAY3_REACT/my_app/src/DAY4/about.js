            <h1>The Journey of MS Dhoni in Indian Cricket</h1>
            <p>
            Dhoni’s journey to cricket stardom continued with an impressive stint in the India A team. In December 2004, he made his debut for the senior national team against Bangladesh. While his debut wasn’t a fireworks display, it was evident that India had unearthed a gem.
            In the 2005-06 season, Dhoni was named the captain of the Indian team in the limited-overs format. He led India to the finals of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, where they lost to Pakistan.

            <p>Dhoni’s journey as a captain was nothing short of remarkable. He took the reins of the Indian team during a challenging period, following their early exit in the 2007 World Cup. The disappointment was palpable among fans, but Dhoni’s first major challenge as captain came during the 2007-08 CB series in Australia. Though India didn’t clinch the title, Dhoni’s composed demeanor and tactical astuteness won over many.
